# Advanced Regression - House Price Prediction
> A US-based housing company named "Surprise Housing" has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company has the data set related to the sale of houses in Australia. The idea is to build a regression model and then additional models using regularisation (Lasso and Ridge), to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- General information: "Surprise Housing" would like to come up with a model, to predict the house prices in the Australian market. 
- Business probem: The company would like to know which variables are significant in predicting the price of the house in the Australian Market". Also, they would like to understand how well those variables describe the price of the house. Based on this understanding, the business team can decide whether to purchase a house or not. 
- Dataset: The dataset (a csv file) has been provided for this exercise

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy, Pandas 
- matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn (linear_model: LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, metrics)

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Conclusions
- A model based on linear regression has been built, to predict the house prices for the Australian Market based on the data shared by "Surprise Housing"
- Then Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression based models were developed to predict the house prices for the Australian Market
